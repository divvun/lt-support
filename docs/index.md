# Language technology support for *all* languages in core digital systems

An effort to document the (lack of) support for most of the languages of the world in all major digital systems.

# Background

- 7000+ languages in the world
- 500+ languages [supported by GBoard](https://www.blog.google/products/search/say-mrhb-msawa-mihofnima-or-hello-500-languages-gboard/)
- 200+ locales [in Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/intl/locales-and-languages)
- 50+ system & TTS languages in [macOS](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206175)
- 20 dictation and Siri languages in macOS & iOS

That is, MOST languages of the world has no support whatsoever. And for those with support, the more advanced language technology, the fewer are supported.

More importantly, no-one else can add their own language to e.g. Siri, or as proofing language in Office 365 on the web. The same goes for Google Docs, and almost all web-based applications.

The core of the present state is that the language is owned by the tech giants, not by the language community anymore, since most language communities have no way of controlling when and how their language is available or used in the digital sphere.

[Technology exists](https://giellalt.github.io) for building [language technology tools](https://github.com/divvun) for most areas and most languages, but making those tools available on the systems people use is a very different matter.
This site aims to document all areas where human languages matter on digital platforms, and whether that area is open for community access or control.
