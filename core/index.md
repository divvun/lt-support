# Basic LT: language codes, fonts, keyboards

For languages to be usable at all on a digital system, a few basic things need to be in place:

- they must be recognised by the system, and recognisable by the users
- it must be possible to display the letters of the language
- it must be possible to input those letters

The following pages cover these core functions:

- [Language codes](iso639codes.md)
- [Fonts](fonts.md)
- [Keyboards](keyboards.md)
