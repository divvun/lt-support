# Android phones

Because of how the Android ecosystem is organised, there can be several layers of adaptations of the Android OS, with each layer having the possibility of altering, restricting or blocking access to language technology services provided by or intermediated by the OS delivered by Google.

Deviations from Google's standard Android is listed in the tables below. There is one table for each category of problem.

Issues will be added as they are found and documented.
